## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn
- A Firebase project

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/admin350/https---github.com-admin350-walletfy.git
    cd https---github.com-admin350-walletfy
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Firebase:**
    - Create a new project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    - Go to Project Settings > General.
    - Under "Your apps", click the web icon (`</>`) to add a new web app.
    - Copy the `firebaseConfig` object.

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    - Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project.
    - Add your Firebase configuration keys to this file. The keys should be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

    ```.env.local
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
    ```

5.  **Set up Firebase Services:**
    - In the Firebase Console, enable **Authentication** and choose the sign-in methods you want to support (e.g., Email/Password).
    - Enable **Cloud Firestore**. When prompted for security rules, start in **production mode**. You can refine these later.

### Running the Development Server

Once the setup is complete, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment

This application is ready to be deployed to any platform that supports Next.js, such as Vercel or Firebase Hosting.

### Deploying to Vercel (Recommended)

1.  Push your code to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
2.  Sign up or log in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
3.  Create a new project and import your Git repository.
4.  Configure the Environment Variables in the Vercel project settings (the same ones from your `.env.local` file).
5.  Deploy! Vercel will automatically build and deploy your Next.js application.
